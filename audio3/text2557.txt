. I've heard there was a secret chord that . David played and it pleased the . Lord . But you don't really care for music do ya . It goes like this the fourth the fifth the minor fall and the major lift . The baffled king composing hallelujah . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah  . Your faith was strong but you needed proof . You saw her bathing on the roof . Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya . She tied you to a kitchen chair . She broke your throne, and she cut your hair . And from your lips she drew the . Hallelujah . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah  . Maybe there's a . God above . And all . I ever learned from love . Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you . And it's not a cry you can hear at night . It's not somebody who's seen the light . It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah, . Hallelujah
