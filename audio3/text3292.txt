. I call you up whenever things go wrong. You’re always there. You are my shoulder to cry on.. I can’t believe it took me so long. To take the forbidden step. Is this something that . I might regret. Nothing ventured nothing gained. A lonely heart that can’t be tame.. I’m hoping that you feel the same. This is something that . I can’t forget.. I thought that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It’s just the beginning it’s not the end. Things will never be the same again.. It’s not a secret anymore. Now we’ve opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We’ll never, never be the same again.. Never be the same again.. Now . I know that we were close before. I’m glad . I realised . I need you so much more.. And . I don’t care what every one will say. It’s about you and me. And we’ll never be the same again.. I though that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It’s just the beginning it’s not the end. Things will never be the same again.. It’s not a secret anymore. Now we’ve opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We’ll never never be the same again.. Never be the same again.[. Lisa . Lopes]. Nite and day.. Black beach sand to red clay.. The . U. S to . U. K, . N. Y. C to . L. A.. From sidewalks to highways.. See it'll never be the same again.. What . I'm sayin'. My mind frame never changed 'til you camerearranged.. But sometimes it seems completely forbidden.. To discover those feelings that we kept sowell hidden.. Where there's no competition.. And you render my condition.. Though improbable it's not impossible.. For a love that could be unstoppable.. But wait.. A fine line's between fate and destiny.. Do you believe in the things that were justmeant to be?. When you tell me the stories of your questfor me.. Picturesque is the picture you painteffortlessly.. And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. Everyday situations, they start to simplify.. So things will never be the same between youand . I.. We intertwined our life forces and now we'reunified.. I thought that we would just be friends. Things will never be the same again. It’s just the beginning it’s not the end. Things will never be the same again. It’s not a secret anymore. Now we’ve opened up the door. Starting tonight and from now on. We’ll never never be the same again. Things will never be the same again. Never be the same again…
