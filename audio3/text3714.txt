. Oh, it just happens. Oh, it just happens. It’s a cabaret. Taking over on a quiet lazy backseat day. And it’s so beautiful. Like the sunshine on your balcony just yesterday. Don’t underestimate. Your heart is never late. And love will always find a way. It just happens. You don’t know what’s going on. If it’s new or if it’s been there since long. If it’s right or wrong. You fall in love. You fall in love. You don’t have a say. Just let it slide and close your eyes. And watch the passion play. Don’t underestimate. Your heart can never wait. And love will always find a way. You fall in love. It just happens. You fall in love. Oh, it just happens, oh yeah(. Ah) you fall in love. It just happens, happens, oh. You fall in love. Don’t underestimate. Your heart can never wait. And love will always find a way. It just happens and you don’t know what’s going on. If it’s new or if it’s been there since long. If it’s right or wrong. You fall in love. Oh, it just happens. You fall in love. It just happens, oh. You fall in love. Oh, it just happens, happens. You fall in love. You fall in love, woo-who. You fall in love. You fall in love. Oh yeah, it just happens, happens, oh. You fall in love. You fall in love
