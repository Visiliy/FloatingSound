. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. It's always beautiful. Until . I mess it up. It's like you don't believe in love. So we lost the touch. It's like you wanna cross wires. Just to cut 'em up. It's like you made the metal. Just so you can see the rust. Like you want the tick-tick-boom. Just to self-destruct. And . I ain't sitting here. Waiting for you to detonate. Pulling pins on hand grenades. And going in for a hug. Building bridges so you can blow 'em up. I can't be your life support. If all you do is really wanna pull the plug. I put myself into the spiral. But you the one that's twisted. It gets hard 'cause . I see poison. Mixed up with a vixen. But listen, it's my fault'. Cause . I love the chase. All you do is give me three letters. You go . M.. I.. A.. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. It's always beautiful. Until . I mess it up. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. The walls are closing in. Because . I built 'em up. There's a part of me. That thinks you love being broken. You built the walls up, then tear them down. Just to see the motion. And that train of thought really put me off-track. Had me thinking 'bout my ex. Like we talking 'bout maths. Three strikes, but you still wanna throw a curve-ball. This here my turn-off. Leave the car turned on. I'ma hop out 'cause . I'm sick of wasting my breath. Clip my wings, tell me to fly. That's your butterfly effect. The cocoon broke out. In that room, no sound. Your silent thoughts can't tell me what to do right now. Chinese whispers gon' make it hard for me to ever listen. You sabotaged the image, so don't ask me for forgiveness. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. It's always beautiful. Until . I've messed it up. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. The walls are closing in. Because . I built 'em up. So don't let me hope too high. Don't let me hope too high'. Cause . I will find a way to tear it down every time. Don't let me hope too high. When everything is right'. Cause . I will find a way to tear it down every time. I sabotage (. Why you sabotage?). Everything . I love (. Everything . I love). It's always beautiful. Until . I mess it up. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. It's always beautiful. Until . I mess it up. Why do . I sabotage. Everything . I love?. The walls are closing in. Because . I built 'em up. Why do . I sabotage?
