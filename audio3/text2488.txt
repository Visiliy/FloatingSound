. Take me back to where we started. That was such a moment back when we were 17. There in your skinny jeans, darling. It's funny how the summer passes. We won't let our love just fade into a memory fall. With the autumn leaves, darling. We get down, we get up. We keep taking the smooth with the rough. We can rise from the dust now'. Cause . I don't believe in impossible. We got a love unstoppablе. With you beside me, . I'm too high to fall. This kind of lovе's unstoppable. I hold you when the nights grow colder. Even when the wind blows wild. And tomorrow don't seem what you thought it would be, yeah. We both know the ties between us. Keep us going strong now. Well, two light around. We never had a doubt, yeah. We get down, we get up. We keep taking the smooth with the rough. We can rise from the dust now'. Cause . I don't believe in impossible. We got a love unstoppable. With you beside me, . I'm too high to fall. This kind of love's unstoppable. We still run like. We still move like. There's nothing in our way. Now come whatever. Here forever. No time won't break the chain. I know you and you know me. You know our dream is not done. Take my hand for one last dance. We'll find our setting sun'. Cause . I don't believe in impossible. We got a love unstoppable. With you beside me, . I'm too high to fall. This kind of love's unstoppable. A love unstoppable(. Yeah, we got a; yeah, we got a). A love unstoppable(. Yeah, we got a; yeah, we got a). A love unstoppable(. Yeah, we got a; yeah, we got a). A love unstoppable. A love unstoppable
