. My heart was born a radical. Electric and dynamical. I never listened to the remedies. But no forevers, no eternities. Holding on beyond the night. For a shadow that feels right. Holding on beyond the night to you. If the dreams we made are made of fire. I would give a life just to live the dream again. If our hearts are hanging on a wire. Let's forget the world below and dance until the end. Let's dancе. Our last dance. A rockin' romance. This ain't our last dance. Lеt's dance. Oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh. Oh-woah-woah-ooh. Oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh. My heart was born in neon lights. Floating in space like satellites. Looking for signs of life tonight. As we collide in black and white. Holdin' on beyond the night. For a shadow that feels right. Holdin' on beyond the night to you. If the dreams we made are made of fire. I would give a life just to live the dream again. Let's dance. Oh, last dance. A rockin' romance. This ain't our last dance. Let's dance. Oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh. Oh-woah-woah-ooh. This ain't our last dance. Take a deeper breath before we touch. Running out of time, let's use it up. And hold me before the morning comes. Let's dance. Oh-oh. A rockin' romance. This ain't our last dance. Let's dance
