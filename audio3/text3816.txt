. Another cigarette picked up my keys and left. Those walls were closing in on me. The rain was falling down. . I felt my heart just pound. With thoughts of how we used to be. It started months ago. . Your distance on the phone. I tried to change so we’d agree. Do what you want to do. . I know that we are through. But tell me why you had to leave. Goodbye. . Lonely words are in my mind. Your eyes don’t hide, your love has died. You’re touchin' someone else tonight. So goodbye. . Don’t forget that you were mine. I’ll try to keep my tears inside. . Goodbye. Goodbye. . Lonely words are in my mind. Your eyes don’t hide, your love has died. You’re touchin' someone else tonight. So goodbye. . Don’t forget that you were mine. I’ll try to keep my tears inside. . Goodbye. The clock is ticking loud. . It seems the only sound. That fills this empty place of need. Reflections on your face. . Your lighter near the vase. Your lipstick on the glass by me. Goodbye. . Lonely words are in my mind. Your eyes don’t hide, your love has died. You’re touchin' someone else tonight. So goodbye. . Don’t forget that you were mine. I’ll try to keep my tears inside. . Goodbye
