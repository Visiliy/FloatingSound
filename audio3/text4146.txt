I wanna drink that smile. I wanna feel like . I'm. Like my soul's on fire. I wanna stay up all day and all night, mm. Yeah, you got me singing like. Ooh, . I love it when you do it like that. And when you're close up, give me thе shivers. Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks. And whеn they say the party's over then we bring it right back. And we say, ooh, . I love it when you do it like that. And when you're close up, give me the shivers. Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks. And when they say the party's over then we bring it right back. Into the car, on the back seat in the moon lit dark. Wrap me up between your legs and arms. Ooh, . I can't get enough. You know you could tear me apart. Put me back together and take my heart. I never thought that . I could love this hard. Ooh, . I can't get enough. Ooh, you got me feeling like. I wanna be that guy. I wanna kiss your eyes. I wanna drink that smile. I wanna feel like . I'm.
