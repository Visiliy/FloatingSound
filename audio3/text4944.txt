When nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?. Come back and stay. Don't keep me waiting, baby. Come back and stay. Don't say goodbye. Don't let my love die. Come back and stay. And try again. Don't walk away. For . I'm still your man. Where are you now?. Where did you go?. Come back and stay. Don't keep me waiting. I'll miss you so. Walk in the rain. Thinking about the game . I play. I am to blame. I lost my lovin' yesterday. Where do broken hearts go to?. How can broken hearts find their way back home. When nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?. Come back and stay. Don't keep me waiting, baby. Come back and stay. Don't say goodbye. Don't let my love die. Come back and stay. And try again. Don't walk away. For . I'm still your man. Where are you now?. Where did you go?. Since . I've been gone . I've missed you. I missed your touch, oh, baby. Come back and stay. Don't keep me waiting, baby. Come back and stay. Don't say goodbye. Don't let my love die. Come back and stay. And try again. Don't walk away. For . I'm still your man. Where are you now?. Where did you go?. Where are you now?
