. Monday, nothing new. It's like . I've work to do. Routine, builds your world. Your walls after all . Friday is coming. Whatchu gonna do?. Time is running. And it up to you. What do you feel?. Always doing right. Is it real?(. I'll have to find) . I see it in your eyes. If it's right. I see it in your eyes. We're denying. We gonna make it right. Feel, feel alive. I wanna see desire in your eyes . You choose and you control. Your rules, you have it all. Your world is black and white. No shades, no flashing lights . Friday is coming. Whatchu gonna do?. Time is running. And it up to you. What do you feel?. Always doing right. Is it real?(. I'll have to find) . I see it in your eyes. If it's right. I see it in your eyes. We're denying. We gonna make it right. Feel, feel alive. I wanna see desire in your eyes
