. She was so young with such innocent eyes. She always dreamt of a fairytale life. And all the things your money can’t buy. She thought daddy was a wonderful guy. Then suddenly, things seemed to change. It was the moment she took on his name. He took his anger out on her face. She kept all of her pain locked away. Oh mother, we’re stronger. From all of the tears you have shed. Oh mother, don’t look back. Cause he’ll never hurt us again. So mother, . I thank you. For all you’ve done and still do . You got me, . I got you. Together we always pull through. We always pull through. We always pull through. Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother. It was the day that he turned on his kids. That she knew she just had to leave him. So many voices inside of her head. Saying over and over and over,«. You deserve much more than this.». She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide. Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises). So tired of defending her life, she could have died. Fighting for the lives of her children. Oh mother, we’re stronger. From all of the tears you have shed. Oh mother, don’t look back. Cause he’ll never hurt us again. So mother, . I thank you. For all you’ve done and still do . You got me, . I got you. Together we always pull through. We always pull through. We always pull through. Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother. All of your life you have spent. Burying hurt and regret. But mama, he’ll never touch us again. For everytime he tried to break you down. Just remember who’s still around. It’s over, and we’re stronger. And we’ll never have to go back again. Oh mother, we’re stronger. From all of the tears you have shed. Oh mother, don’t look back. Cause he’ll never hurt us again. So mother, . I thank you. For all you’ve done and still do . You got me, . I got you. Together we always pull through. We always pull through. We always pull through. Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother. I love you mom…
