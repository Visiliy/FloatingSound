. How come every time you call me baby. Something's wrong and . I feel crazy?. Feel like jumping out of the car. A kiss goodnight, why do . I have to. Make me close my eyes? . I force a daydream. I was close but no cigar. Message in a bottle. Keep it cryptic, my bravado. When you kiss me . I kiss back. You tell a joke, . I fake a laugh. And you ask me if . I'm in this. I'm talking like a politician. I swear it always feels too soon. To do right, tell the truth. How the hell did . I let this get so far?. I'm an angel in your eyes. I can't believe . I got you crying. I'm lying while . I'm lying in your arms. Got the devil by my side. Saying please don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Last week you let me drive us down the highway. In your car without a license. For a moment it felt right. But how come when we pulled up to the party. And you put your arms around me. I started searching for exit signs?. Message in a bottle. See me running from our problems. Swear it always feels too soon. To do right, tell the truth. How the hell did . I let this get so far?. I'm an angel in your eyes. I can't believe . I got you crying. I'm lying while . I'm lying in your arms. Got the devil by my side. Saying please don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Can you feel it?. Can you feel it?. Can you feel me, yeah. Disappearing. Disappearing. Disappearing, yeah. Can you feel it?. Can you feel it?. Can you feel me, yeah. Disappearing. Disappearing. Disappearing. How the hell did . I let this get so far?. I'm an angel in your eyes. I can't believe . I got you crying. I'm lying while . I'm lying in your arms. Got the devil by my side. Saying please don't break his heart. Don't break his heart. Don't break his heart
