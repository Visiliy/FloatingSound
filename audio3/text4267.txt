[. Chorus]. I'm up peaking in the night. When it's dark, you see me shine. I ain't gonna live to stay alive. Love is gonna get me. Ooh-ooh, feels like . I got my throat against the knife. Ooh-ooh, . I wasn't made to live an ordinary life[. Verse 1: . Wiz . Khalifa]. I don't ever use breaks. I don't ever use breaks. Fuck up out my face. I'ma break shit. Smoke a ounce, not a eighth. I get mine every day. If . I want it, . I'ma motherfuckin' take it. What you know about goin' out and makin' everything you want?. Used to make to call the weed man, now . I'm the plug. Move the pounds out in public. Used to run away from it. Now . I'm gettin' love. Who the one who made millions off of bub'. When they said it was a drug?. Who the one who hit the stage high as fuck. Every day and get love?[. Chorus]. I'm up peaking in the night. When it's dark, you see me shine. I ain't gonna live to stay alive. Love is gonna get me. Ooh-ooh, feels like . I got my throat against the knife. Ooh-ooh, . I wasn't made to live an ordinary life[. Verse 2: . K. D. D. K]. What you know about love when you hated by race?. They don't care about face. They just made up their face. Hundred dollar bills, green. Do you know what . I mean?. Hollywood's don't matter. They got no colour. Like a wheeze in a squeeze, squeeze every penny'. Cause . I can't fit my family with the . Grammy's. I used to be a wannabee in the streets, stranger. Now . I'm major independent, danger[. Chorus]. I'm up peaking in the night. When it's dark, you see me shine. I ain't gonna live to stay alive. Love is gonna get me. Ooh-ooh, feels like . I got my throat against the knife. Ooh-ooh, . I wasn't made to live an ordinary life[. Bridge: . Wiz . Khalifa]. No, they don't want me to win. But . I can still feel the love. No, they don't want me to win. But . I can still feel the love. No, they don't want me to win. But . I can still feel the love. No, they don't want me to win. But . I can still feel the love[. Chorus]. I'm up peaking in the night. When it's dark, you see me shine. I ain't gonna live to stay alive. Love is gonna get me. Ooh-ooh, feels like . I got my throat against the knife. Ooh-ooh, . I wasn't made to live an ordinary life
