. All my friends are toxic. All ambitionless, so rude and always negative. I need new friends. But it’s not that quick and easy. Oh, . I’m drowning, let me breathe. I’m better off all by myself. Though . I’m feelin' kind of empty without somebody else. Oh, . I hear you cryin' out for help. But you never showed for me when . I was ringin' your cell phone. Oh, you don’t know, how it feels to be alone. Baby, oh, . I’ll make you know, . I’ll make you know, oh. I’m drowning, let me breathe. I’m drowning, let me breathe. I’m drowning, let me breathe. I’m drowning, let me breathe. But life is immaculate. Backin' it up a bit. Counting up my hours and knocking on wood. Avoiding my opposites. Chewin' on chocolate. Had a bit limited time but .

But this is where good guys die. You took my pride away. But you cannot take my life. I’ll find another way. I’ll takin' my life. Don’t you see how . I. I’m better off all by myself. Though . I’m feelin' kind of empty without somebody else. Oh, . I hear you cryin' out for help. But you never showed for me when . I was ringin' your cell phone. Oh, you don’t know, how it feels to be alone. Baby, oh, . I’ll make you know, . I’ll make you know, oh. I’m better off all by myself. Though . I’m feelin' kind of empty without somebody else. Oh, . I hear you cryin' out for help. But you never showed for me when . I was ringin' your cell phone. Oh, you don’t know, how it feels to be alone. Baby, oh, . I’ll make you know, . I’ll make you know, oh
