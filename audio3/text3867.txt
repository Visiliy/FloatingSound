. Take a breath,. Rest your head,. Close your eyes.. You're alright.. Just lay down.. Turn my side.. Do you feel my heat. On your skin?. Take off your clothes,. Blow out the fire.. Don't be so shy.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off my clothes.. Oh bless me father!. Don't ask me why.. You're alright. You're alright. Home, . I stay. I'm in, come in. Do you feel my hips. In your hands?. And . I'm laying down. By your side.. I taste the sweet. Of your skin. Take off your clothes,. Blow out the fire.. Don't be so shy.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off my clothes.. Oh bless me father!. Don't ask me why.. You're alright. You're alright. And my heart's race. Raised so much faster. I drown myself in holy water. And both my eyes. Just got so much brighter. And . I saw . God. Oh yeah so much closer. In the dark. I see your smile.. Do you feel my heat. On my skin?. Take off your clothes,. Blow out the fire.. Don't be so shy.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off my clothes.. Oh bless me father!. Don't ask me why.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off your clothes,. Blow out the fire.. Don't be so shy.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off my clothes.. Oh bless me father!. Don't ask me why.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off your clothes,. Blow out the fire.. Don't be so shy.. You're alright. You're alright. Take off my clothes.. And bless me further!. Don't ask me why.. Don't ask me why. Don't ask me why
