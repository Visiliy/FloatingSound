. We've been together for a decade now. Still everyday . I'm lovin' you more. If . I could do it all again. I'd probably do it all the same as before. I don't wanna know what would've happened if .

Finds a new way to grow). The time we spend together. Hmm, feels good. How does it keep getting better?. Every day our love finds a new way to grow. The time we spend together. Hmm, simply feels good. We got a good thing going
