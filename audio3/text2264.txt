. There's fire in the rain. But we'll get up again. We're thousand miles apart. But we'll overcome. I'll never let you down. World is turning us around. But . I feel it in my heart. Let's make a brand new start. Can't stop us now, forget the haters. Get up and live and make it matter. There's more to life so go ahead and sing it out. Can you hear a million voices. Calling out in the rain?. You know we got a million choices. So go get out and let it rain. A million voices, voices. A million voices, voices. A million voices, voices. A million voices. There's fire in the rain. And . I can feel your pain. Painting all the scars in. The colors of change. Don't let them hold you down. Don't let them hold you down. Go shooting like a star.
