. You saved, you know you saved me . When you never gave up on me baby. Walked away, you care about me now . I’m yours. My heart was so rejected. You gave me shelter to protect it . Far away, so reconnected. Now . I’m yours. And . I…. Wish you could see the way . I see you. Just like the morning when it breaks through. Best part of me is when . I met you. And . I’m never gonna leave, that . I’ll never be . If . I could give you what you gave me . Then you would know what that’d make me . When the world is trying to knock you…. I’ll be your safety. Safety… safety… your safety. I’ll be your safety…. I’ll be your safety…. Safety… safety… your safety. The chains, . I felt you break them. Wrapped your arms around me to replace them. Took my hand, forgave my mistakes and now . I’m yours. That’s why . I’m always gonna be there. When life reminds us that it’s not fair. I’ll pick you up and take you to a place where . I am yours. Wish you could see the way . I see you. Just like the morning when it breaks through. Best part of me is when . I met you. And . I’m never gonna leave, that’ll never be . If . I could give you what you gave me . Then you would know what that’d make me . When the world is trying to knock you…. I’ll be your safety. Safety… safety… your safety. I’ll be your safety…. I’ll be your safety…. Safety… safety… your safety. Tell you once, tell you twice, tell you everytime. I’ll never leave what . I need, you’re my lifeline. Through the darkest, coldest nights ohhh baby. Wish you could see the way . I see you. Just like the morning when it breaks through. Best part of me is when . I met you. And . I’m never gonna leave, that’ll never be . If . I could give you what you gave me . Then you would know what that’d make me . When the world is trying to knock you…. I’ll be your safety…. I’ll be your safety…. Safety… safety… your safety. I’ll be your safety…. I’ll be your safety…. Safety… safety… your safety. I’ll be your safety…. You’re safe, . I’ll be your safety
