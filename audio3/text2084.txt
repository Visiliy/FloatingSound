If we listened to ourselves. We’d know it’s time for something new to start. Cause . I heart. Chorus:. I’m going through changes. All the things . I’ve had r new. That . I wanna him with u feel wrong. And u know what’s strangest?. I think u feel the same. Don’t let guilt make u stay, it’s . O. K!. Cause everything changes, changes, changes
