Nostalgia, what a funny feelin'I feel depleted from feelings I've been revealin'It's do or die, I'm not goin' willingBut when it's time, wrap in white linenI rap this, I say it for my sanityWhatever the calamity, I did this for myselfFuck all of your fantasiesYou're a snake, fell off the ladderI prefer speakin' in analogiesI’ve had enough of all this wetAnd I can't trust that you're my familyI don't know what's nextThe brain dead that I never missMy brain lives with the cannabisCan I resist the dark abyss?Leave a mark on this with no start, just existMy mind's in a prism shapeAnd in timеs like a prison stateTherе's no right that I feel of lateThere's no light if my view's at stakeAnd which life should I choose to take?What's left, is it room or space?There are rumors we have to faceI prefer sooner than after lateI seen actors after BAFTA's be more straightI mean down the barrelI hear 'em sing, it's the same carolThey're tryna sprint in a long run, Mo FarahThey're tryna fix when it's long gone, don't botherThere's no other, the thought shudders through most loversI wanna bed you, but still sleep is death's cousinSo two weeks is now four dozenYears that pass by, can't press no rewindJust watch my life by and lock the right tiesNobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to meNobody, nobody-ayy is listenin'Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to meNobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
