I let it fall, my heart,And as it fell you rose to claim itIt was dark and I was overUntil you kissed my lips and you saved meMy hands, they're strongBut my knees were far too weak,To stand in your armsWithout falling to your feetBut there's a side to youThat I never knew, never knew.All the things you'd sayThey were never true, never true,And the games you playYou would always win, always win.But I set fire to the rain,Watched it pour as I touched your face,Well, it burned while I cried'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!When I lay with youI could stay thereClose my eyesFeel you here foreverYou and me togetherNothing gets better'Cause there's a side to youThat I never knew, never knew,All the things you'd say,They were never true, never true,And the games you'd playYou would always win, always win.But I set fire to the rain,Watched it pour as I touched your face,Well, it burned while I cried'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!I set fire to the rainAnd I threw us into the flamesWhen it fell, something died'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!Sometimes I wake up by the door,That heart you caught must be waiting for youEven now when we're already overI can't help myself from looking for you.I set fire to the rain,Watched it pour as I touched your face,Well, it burned while I cried'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your nameI set fire to the rain,And I threw us into the flamesWhen it fell, something died'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, ohhhh!Oh nooooLet it burn, ohLet it burnLet it burn
