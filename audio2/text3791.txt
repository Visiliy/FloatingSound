Remember those walls I built Well baby they're tumbling downAnd they didn't even put up a fightThey didn't even make a soundI found a way to let you inBut I never really had a doubtStanding in the light of your haloI got my angel nowIt's like I've been awakenedEvery rule I had you breakin'It's the risk that I'm takin'I ain't never gonna shut you outEverywhere I'm looking nowI'm surrounded by your embraceBaby I can see your haloYou know you're my saving graceYou're everything I need and moreIt's written all over your faceBaby I can feel your haloPray it won't fade awayI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo) haloI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo) haloHit me like a ray of sunBurning through my darkest nightYou're the only one that I wantThink I'm addicted to your lightI swore I'd never fall againBut this don't even feel like fallingGravity can't forgetto pull me back to the ground againFeels like I've been awakenedEvery rule I had you breakin'The risk that I'm takin'I'm never gonna shut you outEverywhere I'm looking nowI'm surrounded by your embraceBaby I can see your haloYou know you're my saving graceYou're everything I need and moreIt's written all over your faceBaby I can feel your haloPray it won't fade awayI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo) haloI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo) haloI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo)Everywhere I'm looking nowI'm surrounded by your embraceBaby I can see your haloYou know you're my saving graceYou're everything I need and moreIt's written all over your faceBaby I can feel your haloPray it won't fade awayI can feel your halo (halo) haloI can see your halo (halo) haloI can feel your halo (halo) halo
