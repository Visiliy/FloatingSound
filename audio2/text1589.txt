Hi! Who me? Why?Feet don't fail me now take me to the finish lineOh, my heart, it breaks every step that I takeBut I'm hoping that at the gates they'll tell me that you're mineWalking through the city streets is it by mistake or design?I feel so alone on a Friday night can you make it feel like homeIf I tell you you're mine? It's like I told you honeyDon't make me sad, don't make me crySometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know whyKeep making me laugh let's go get highThe road is long we carry on try to have fun in the meantimeCome take a walk on the wild sideLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rainYou like your girls insaneSo choose your last words this is the last time'Cause you and I we were born to dieLost but now I am foundI can see that once I was blindI was so confused as a little child try'na take what I could getScared that I couldn't find all the answers, honeyDon't make me sad, don't make me crySometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know whyKeep making me laugh let's go get highThe road is long we carry on try to have fun in the meantimeCome take a walk on the wild sideLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rainYou like your girls insaneSo choose your last words this is the last time'Cause you and I we were born to die(We were born, we were born) we were born to die(We were born, we were born) we were born to dieCome take a walk on the wild sideLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rainYou like your girls insaneDon't make me sad, don't make me crySometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know whyKeep making me laugh let's go get highThe road is long we carry on try to have fun in the meantimeCome take a walk on the wild sideLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rainYou like your girls insaneSo choose your last words this is the last time'Cause you and I we were born to die(We were born, we were born) we were born to die(We were born, we were born) we were born to die(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born)(We were born, we were born to die)
