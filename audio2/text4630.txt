Ev'rybody's telling you what you wanna hearSo how you gonna know what's fake and what's realWho's gonna tell you things ain't so greatWhen your so-called friends won't tell it to your faceFair weather, foul weather ev'ry kind of moodI'll be there for you standing like a tower of truthWho's gonna get you through the sum of all fearsWhen the world is crum'bling around your earsWhen the lights go outWill you face the dark alone?Or will you call my name?Cause I'll be there and I'll be strongWhere are you? Where are you?Even the shadows call your nameOh, I will never be the sameWhile I keep searching on and onLiving my life, living my life without youWhere are you?Meet me in the garden come break of dayReach into the dawn and you can touch my faceMeet me in the morning it's a beautiful placeSeek me in the shadows where your thoughts all strayEv'rybody's wondering where is the loveIt's a heartbeat beating on the wings of a doveSeek and you'll find me never be ashamedWhen I wrap my love around you then you'll know my nameWhen the lights go outWill you face the dark alone?Or will you call my name?Cause I'll be there and I'll be strongWhere are you? Where are you?Even the shadows call your nameOh, I will never be the sameWhile I keep searching on and onLiving my life, living my life without youWhere are you?Where are you? Where are you?I'll be there and I'll be strongWhere are you? Where are you?Even the shadows call your nameOh, I will never be the sameWhile I keep searching on and onLiving my life, living my life without youEven the shadows call your nameOh, I will never be the sameWhile I keep searching on and onLiving my life, living my life without youWhere are you?
