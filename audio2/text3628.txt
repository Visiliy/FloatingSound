I wish that heaven had visiting hoursSo I could just show up and bring the newsThat she's getting older and I wish that you'd met herThe things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from youCan I stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wineAnd soon they're going to close but I'll see you another daySo much has changed since you been awayI wish that heaven had visiting hoursSo I could just swing by and ask your adviceWhat would you do in my situation?I haven't a clue how I'd even raise themWhat would you do? 'Cause you always do what's rightCan we just talk a while until my worries disappear?I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failureYou'd say remember that the answer in the love that we createSo much has changed since you been awayI wish that heaven had visiting hoursAnd I would ask them if I could take you homeBut I know what they'd say, that it's for the bestSo I will live life the way you taught meAnd make it on my ownAnd I will close the door but I will open up my heartAnd everyone I love will know exactly who you are'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just till we meet againSo much has changed since you been away
