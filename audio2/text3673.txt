Wonder if it ever crossed your mindThat what we had was really unbelievable, unbeatable, a miracleWhy'd you have to go and mess it up?Why'd you have to make what was unbreakable shakable, unsavable?And now it's too late to cross your fingersI'm wide awake and not a dreamerHate it, but it seems the dreams were never trueFor a little while the fates were with usWonder why they had to turn against usI could make a wish, but there is no useI can feelEven though I'm numbThe change to come will hurt someoneI can seeThis time it isn't meI might be the lucky oneI don't need a crystal ball to show meBaby, it is plain that you don't know meWhen it comes to you I'm better off alone (Better off alone)I don't need a crystal ball to make meRealize that if I stay you'll break meEvery sign is saying I should be goneI should be goneThought I had a cloud over my headIt had to be my fault that it kept raining downUntil now, I figured outThat if I had the nerve to say goodbyeI could look for clearer skies up over headWeather says sun insteadI don't need a crystal ball to show meBaby, it is plain that you don't know meWhen it comes to you I'm better off alone (Better off alone)I don't need a crystal ball to make meRealize that if I stay you'll break meEvery sign is saying I should be goneI should be goneI can feel (Even though I'm numb)The change to come will hurt someoneI can see (I can feel)This time it isn't meI might be the lucky oneI don't need a crystal ball to show meBaby, it is plain that you don't know meWhen it comes to you I'm better off alone (Better off alone)I don't need a crystal ball to make meRealize that if I stay you'll break meEvery sign is saying I should be goneI should be gone
