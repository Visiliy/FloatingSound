Isn’t it a thing that you’ve said?Isn’t it s thing that you’ve done?Isn’t it a thing that I think we could overcome?It’s not even a fight we could blameLover that I could nameIt’s harder to take when things ain’t so quietlySlowly they start, cracks in your heartTill all you know is drifting apartChorus:I’m going through changesAll the things I’ve had r newThat I wanna him with u feel wrongAnd u know what’s strangest?I think u feel the sameDon’t let guilt make u stay, it’s OK!Cause everything changes, changes, changesThere is nothing in the past I regretKnowing than I’m man enough for itI will never want to forget these memoriesI’m looking for somebody elseI’m trying to find myselfIts been nice for so longWho did I used to beThis is a role I don’t want to playTry to find a way I can see.Chorus:I’m going through changesAll the things I’ve had r newThat I wanna him with u feel wrongAnd u know what’s strangest?I think u feel the sameDon’t let guilt make u stay, it’s OK!Cause everything changes, changes, changesIf we listened to ourselvesWe’d know it’s time for something new to startCause I heartChorus:I’m going through changesAll the things I’ve had r newThat I wanna him with u feel wrongAnd u know what’s strangest?I think u feel the sameDon’t let guilt make u stay, it’s OK!Cause everything changes, changes, changes
