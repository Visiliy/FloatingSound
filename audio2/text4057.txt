How come every time you call me babySomething's wrong and I feel crazy?Feel like jumping out of the carA kiss goodnight, why do I have toMake me close my eyes? I force a daydreamI was close but no cigarMessage in a bottleKeep it cryptic, my bravadoWhen you kiss me I kiss backYou tell a joke, I fake a laughAnd you ask me if I'm in thisI'm talking like a politicianI swear it always feels too soonTo do right, tell the truthHow the hell did I let this get so far?I'm an angel in your eyesI can't believe I got you cryingI'm lying while I'm lying in your armsGot the devil by my sideSaying please don't break his heartDon't break his heartDon't break his heartLast week you let me drive us down the highwayIn your car without a licenseFor a moment it felt rightBut how come when we pulled up to the partyAnd you put your arms around meI started searching for exit signs?Message in a bottleSee me running from our problemsSwear it always feels too soonTo do right, tell the truthHow the hell did I let this get so far?I'm an angel in your eyesI can't believe I got you cryingI'm lying while I'm lying in your armsGot the devil by my sideSaying please don't break his heartDon't break his heartDon't break his heartDon't break his heartCan you feel it?Can you feel it?Can you feel me, yeahDisappearingDisappearingDisappearing, yeahCan you feel it?Can you feel it?Can you feel me, yeahDisappearingDisappearingDisappearingHow the hell did I let this get so far?I'm an angel in your eyesI can't believe I got you cryingI'm lying while I'm lying in your armsGot the devil by my sideSaying please don't break his heartDon't break his heartDon't break his heart
