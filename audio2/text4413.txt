[Chorus:]Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby aloneI don't want nobody else to hold youThat's a chance I'll takeBaby I'll stay, Heaven can waitNo, if the angels took me from this earthI would tell them bring me back to herIt's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stayHeaven can waitYou're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so...You're beautifulEach moment spent with you is simply wonderfulThis love I have for you girl it's incredibleAnd I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with youThe world could not go on so every night I prayIf the Lord should come for me before I wakeI wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you closeWhat good would Heaven beIf the angels came for me I'd tell them no[Chorus]UnthinkableMe sitting up in the clouds and you are all aloneThe time might come around when you'd be moving onI'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girlCan't stand to see nobody kissing, touching herCouldn't take nobody loving you the way we wereWhat good would Heaven beIf the angels come for me I'd tell them no[Chorus]Oh no, can't be without my babyWon't go, without her I'd go crazyOh no, guess Heaven will be waitingOohOh no, can't be without my babyWon't go, without her I'd go crazyOh no, guess Heaven will be waitingOoh[Chorus]Just leave us alone, leave us alonePlease leave us alone
