Loving can hurt,Loving can hurt sometimesBut it's the only thing that I knowWhen it gets hard,You know it can get hard sometimesIt is the only thing that makes us feel aliveWe keep this love in a photographWe made these memories for ourselvesWhere our eyes are never closingHearts are never brokenAnd time's forever frozen, stillSo you can keep meInside the pocket of your ripped jeansHolding me closer 'til our eyes meetYou won't ever be alone,Wait for me to come homeLoving can heal,Loving can mend your soulAnd it's the only thing that I knowI swear it will get easier,Remember that with every piece of yaAnd it's the only thing to take with us when we dieWe keep this love in a photographWe made these memories for ourselvesWhere our eyes are never closingHearts were never brokenAnd time's forever frozen, stillSo you can keep meInside the pocket of your ripped jeansHolding me closer 'til our eyes meetYou won't ever be aloneAnd if you hurt meThat's okay baby, only words bleedInside these pages you just hold meAnd I won’t ever let you goWait for me to come homeWait for me to come homeWait for me to come homeWait for me to come homeYou can fit meInside the necklace you got when you were sixteenNext to your heartbeat where I should beKeep it deep within your soulAnd if you hurt meThat's okay baby, only words bleedInside these pages you just hold meAnd I won’t ever let you goWhen I'm away, I will remember how you kissed meUnder the lamppost back on Sixth streetHearing you whisper through the phone«Wait for me to come home»
