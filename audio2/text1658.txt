I wish I could flyI'd pick you up and we'd go back in timeI'd write this in the skyI miss you like it was the very first nightAnd so it goesEvery weekend, the same partyI never go aloneAnd I don't seem broken-heartedMy friends all say they knowEverything I'm going throughI drive down different roadsBut they all lead back to you'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotelThey weren't ridin' in the car when we both fellDidn't read the note on the Polaroid pictureThey don't know how much I miss youI wish I could flyI'd pick you up and we'd go back in timeI'd write this in the skyI miss you like it was the very first nightAnd so it wasWe never saw it comingNot trying to fall in loveBut we did like children runningBack then, we didn't knowWe were built to fall apartWe broke the status quoThen we broke each other's heartsBut don't forget about the night out in L.ADance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallwayNo one knows about the words that we whisperedNo one knows how much I miss youI wish I could flyI'd pick you up and we'd go back in timeI'd write this in the skyI miss you like it was the very first nightTake me awayTake me awayTake me awayTo you, to youTake me awayTake me awayTake me awayTo you, to youI remember the night at the hotelI was ridin' in the car when we both fellI'm the one on the phone as you whisper"Do you know how much I miss you?"I wish that we could go back in timeAnd I'd say to you"I miss you like it was the very first night"I wish I could flyI'd pick you up and we'd go back in timeI'd write this in the skyI miss you like it was the very first nightTake me awayTake me awayTake me awayTo you, to youTake me awayTake me awayTake me awayTo you, to you
