I dream of rainI dream of gardens in the desert sandI wake in vainI dream of loveAs time runs through my handI dream of fireThese dreams are tied to a horse that will never tireAnd in the flamesHer shadows play in the shape of a man's desireThis desert roseEach of her veils, a secret promiseThis desert flowerNo sweet perfume everTortured me more than thisAnd as she turnsThis way she moves in the logic of all my dreamsThis fire burnsI realize that nothing's as it seemsI dream of rainI dream of gardens in the desert sandI wake in vainI dream of loveAs time runs through my handI dream of rainI lift my gaze to empty skies aboveI close my eyes, this rare perfumeIs the sweet intoxication of her loveI dream of rainI dream of gardens in the desert sandI wake in vainI dream of loveAs time runs through my handSweet desert roseEach of her veils, a secret promiseThis desert flowerNo sweet perfume everTortured me more than thisSweet desert roseThis memory of Eden haunts us allThis desert flower, this rare perfume
