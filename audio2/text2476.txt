I wake up and I think I could use another drinkI’m reaching for a smoke to forget about last night, last nightI get up 'cause I need a shot of instant remedyI put a record on, it makes me think about last night, last nightIt all ended in the weirdest chipHe started actin' way too hipThat’s why I ignored you for a long, long timeBut then you had the best opening lineYou’re in the wrong placeYou’re lying next to me, I don’t know where to hideI see his smiley face that makes me wanna cryWhat was I thinking? 'Cause all we did was fightDon’t you ever dare to wear my Johnny Cash t-shirtYou’re in the wrong place, you’re in the wrong placeYou wake up and you think you won’t need another drinkYou don’t want me to smoke, though I didn’t stop last night, last nightYou get up 'cause you need an organic cup of teaYou put a record on, it makes you think about last night, last nightYou confuse me with your blurry eyesThought you were a different kind of guyThat’s why I took you to my messy placeBut it felt as if we were in a different spaceYou’re in the wrong placeYou’re lying next to me, I don’t know where to hideI see his smiley face that makes me wanna cryWhat was I thinking? 'Cause all we did was fightDon’t you ever dare to wear my Johnny Cash t-shirtYou’re in the wrong place, you’re in the wrong placeYou’re in the wrong place, you’re in the wrong placeYou’re in the wrong place, you’re in the wrong placeDon’t you ever dare to wear my Johnny Cash t-shirt
