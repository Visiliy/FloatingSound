Whoa, my loveMy darlingI've hungered for your touchA long, lonely timeAnd time goes by so slowlyAnd time can do so muchAre you still mine?I need your loveI need your loveGod speed your love to meLonely rivers flow to the sea, to the seaTo the open arms of the seaLonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for meI'll be coming home, wait for me"Whoa, my loveMy darlingI've hungered, hungered for your touchA long, lonely timeAnd time goes by so slowlyAnd time can do so muchAre you still mine?I need your loveI need your loveGod speed your love to me
