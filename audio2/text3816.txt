Another cigarette picked up my keys and leftThose walls were closing in on meThe rain was falling down. I felt my heart just poundWith thoughts of how we used to beIt started months ago. Your distance on the phoneI tried to change so we’d agreeDo what you want to do. I know that we are throughBut tell me why you had to leaveGoodbye. Lonely words are in my mindYour eyes don’t hide, your love has diedYou’re touchin' someone else tonightSo goodbye. Don’t forget that you were mineI’ll try to keep my tears inside. GoodbyeGoodbye. Lonely words are in my mindYour eyes don’t hide, your love has diedYou’re touchin' someone else tonightSo goodbye. Don’t forget that you were mineI’ll try to keep my tears inside. GoodbyeThe clock is ticking loud. It seems the only soundThat fills this empty place of needReflections on your face. Your lighter near the vaseYour lipstick on the glass by meGoodbye. Lonely words are in my mindYour eyes don’t hide, your love has diedYou’re touchin' someone else tonightSo goodbye. Don’t forget that you were mineI’ll try to keep my tears inside. Goodbye
