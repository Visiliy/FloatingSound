I feel so unsureAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floorAs the music dies, something in your eyesCalls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyesI'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with youTime can never mendThe careless whispers of a good friendTo the heart and mind, ignorance is kindThere's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll findI'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with youNever without your loveTonight the music seems so loudI wish that we could lose this crowdMaybe it's better this wayWe'd hurt each other with the things we want to sayWe could have been so good togetherWe could have lived this dance foreverBut now who's gonna dance with me?Please stay, and...I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythmThough it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a foolI should have known better than to cheat a friendAnd waste a chance that I'd been givenSo I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with youNow that you're gone, now that you're goneNow that you're gone, was what I did so wrong, so wrongThat you had to leave me alone?
