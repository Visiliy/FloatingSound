Another day has goneI'm still all aloneHow could this beYou're not here with meYou never said goodbyeSomeone tell me whyDid you have to goAnd leave my world so coldEveryday I sit and ask myselfHow did love slip awaySomething whispers in my ear and saysThat you are not aloneFor I am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayYou are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartYou are not aloneAll aloneWhy, ohJust the other nightI thought I heard you cryAsking me to comeAnd hold you in my armsI can hear your prayersYour burdens I will bearBut first I need your handSo forever can beginEveryday I sit and ask myselfHow did love slip awayThen something whispers in my ear and saysThat you are not aloneFor I am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayFor you are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartAnd you are not aloneWhisper three words and I'll come runnin'And girl you know that I'll be thereI'll be thereYou are not aloneI am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayYou are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartYou are not aloneFor I am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayFor you are not aloneFor I am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartFor you are not alone
