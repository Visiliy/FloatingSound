Hope I only leave good vibes on your living room floorIt hurt so bad that I didn't when you asked for moreYour dad probably loves me more than he ever did now'Cause I finally got out, yeah, we finally knocked down'Cause sometimes it's better that wayGotta let it go so your heart don't break'Cause I love youYeah baby I love youJust this one time hear what I'm tryna sayKnow you might not feel quite the same wayBut I love youI tell you, I love youWhy? Why wait to fight?Give it a tryOr I'll say goodbye while it's rightCan we save tears in your eyesI'm making you cryWhy wait to hate? Can we save love?I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for youI can't let you fall through the floor tooIt's a gamble to take any more of you(It's a gamble to take any more of you)Still in my mind sometimes, I must admit itLike it's a crime on trial, I got acquittedMe and you wasn't meant, we wasn't fittedLike it's a glove, I hated to admit it'Cause obviously we go backSo why would we ruin that?In too deep, we're rearrangedNow you wanna ask for namesWe can't let this fruit go badSaying things we can't take backIn too deep, we're rearrangedSay you feel the sameWhy? Why wait to fight?Give it a tryOr I'll say goodbye while it's rightCan we save tears in your eyesAnd watching you cryWhy wait to hate? Can we save love?
