A lifetime’s starting to feel like it’s falling short of the markBut it’s all that we gotEvery teardropEvery wrong turnMade the moment we foundAnd it’s coming around, around, around, aroundI don’t wanna miss one thing, we can turn the whole world downAnd listen to the in-between, we are, we are the soundThere’s nothing but the space we’re in, the hurry and the noise shut outJust stay here and be right nowThe shadows cling to the ceiling And fracture the light that lands in our eyes Every moment changes the whole viewAnd just when it endsI feel it again, again, again, againI don’t wanna miss one thing, we can turn the whole world downAnd listen to the in-between, we are, we are the soundThere’s nothing but the space we’re in, the hurry and the noise shut outJust stay here and be right nowNothing else mattersStay here and be right nowNothing else mattersJust stay here and be right nowI don’t wanna miss one thing, we can turn the whole world downAnd listen to the in-between, we are, we are the soundThere’s nothing but the space we’re in, the hurry and the noise shut outJust stay here and be right now
