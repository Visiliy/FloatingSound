oh...I feel like I've been locked up tightFor a century of lonely nights;Waiting for someoneTo release me.You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way,But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away;Baby, baby, baby.(Baby, baby, baby.)Oh whoa...My body's saying let's go.Oh whoa...But my heart is saying no.If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price you pay.I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true.You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do.I'm a genie in a bottle, baby.Gotta rub me the right way, honey.I'm a genie in a bottle, baby,Come, come, come and let me out.The music's playing and the lights' down low,One more dance and then we're good to go;Waiting for someoneWho needs me.My heart is beating at the speed of light,But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight;Baby, baby, baby.(Baby, baby, baby)Oh whoa...My body's saying let's go.Oh whoa...But my heart is saying no.If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price you pay.I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true.Come and set me free, baby, and I'll be with you.I'm a genie in a bottle, baby.Gotta rub me the right way, honey.I'm a genie in a bottle, baby,Come, come, come and let me out.Oh whoa...My body's saying let's go.Oh whoa...But my heart is saying no.If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price you pay.I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true.You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do.If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price you pay.I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true.Come and set me free, baby, and I'll be with you.I'm a genie in a bottle, baby,Come, come, come and let me out.
