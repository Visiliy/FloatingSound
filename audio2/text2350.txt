Do you remember when we fell in loveWe were young and innocent thenDo you remember how it all beganIt just seemed like heaven so why did it end?Do you remember back in the fallWe'd be together all day longDo you remember us holding handsIn each other's eyes we'd stare (tell me)Do you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the time when we first metDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the timeDo you remember how we used to talk (ya know)We'd stay on the phone at night till dawnDo you remember all the things we said likeI love you so, I'll never let you goDo you remember back in the springEvery morning birds would singDo you remember those special timesThey'll just go on and on in the back of my mindDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the time when we first metDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the timeThose sweet memories will always be dear to meAnd girl no matter what was saidI will never forget what we had now babyDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the time when we first metDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the timeDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the time when we first metDo you remember the time when we fell in loveDo you remember the timeRemember the times, Ooh!Remember the times, do you remember girlRemember the times, on the phone you and meRemember the times, till dawn, two or threeWhat about us girl!Remember the times.
