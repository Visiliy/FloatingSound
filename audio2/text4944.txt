Walk in the rainTryin' to wash away the painYou went awayI made you cry so many daysWhere do broken hearts go to?How can broken hearts find their way back homeWhen nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?Come back and stayDon't keep me waiting, babyCome back and stayDon't say goodbyeDon't let my love dieCome back and stayAnd try againDon't walk awayFor I'm still your manWhere are you now?Where did you go?Come back and stayDon't keep me waitingI'll miss you soWalk in the rainThinking about the game I playI am to blameI lost my lovin' yesterdayWhere do broken hearts go to?How can broken hearts find their way back homeWhen nobody cares about you and you're feeling blue?Come back and stayDon't keep me waiting, babyCome back and stayDon't say goodbyeDon't let my love dieCome back and stayAnd try againDon't walk awayFor I'm still your manWhere are you now?Where did you go?Since I've been gone I've missed youI missed your touch, oh, babyCome back and stayDon't keep me waiting, babyCome back and stayDon't say goodbyeDon't let my love dieCome back and stayAnd try againDon't walk awayFor I'm still your manWhere are you now?Where did you go?Where are you now?
