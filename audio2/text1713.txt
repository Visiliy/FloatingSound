I’m gonna let go of the armorLet off the power that I’ve been lightingNot afraid of the monsters, of the nightmaresThat I’ve been fightingEasy to run, harder to stayFinding colors in the greyYou thought I was doneBut I’ve gotta go onI fell twice, now I’m twice as strongI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back homeI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back homeI had to take all of the wrong waysAll of the wrong waysAs I couldn’t seeAll the signs, all the mistakesPointing one way to get back to meEasy to run, harder to stayFinding colors in the greyYou thought I was doneBut I’ve gotta go onI fell twice, now I’m twice as strongI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back homeI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back homeMy soul is a map, my heart is a compassI am the roadThere’s only one way to goThis is the way back homeMy soul is a map, my heart is a compassI am the roadThere’s only one way to goThis is the way back homeI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back homeI’ve been searching all the wrong placesI’ve been trying too many facesOnly one way to goThis is the way back home
