Cause all I just wanted was your loveThem birds in the sky sing our old songsYou never really know what you got 'till it's all goneCause all I just wanted was your loveIt's like I hear you callinIt's like I hear your fearsI wake up in the morningAnd you are are never hereStay with me, don't you leaveI can feel your heart it's floating through the breezeCause all I just wanted was your loveThem birds in the sky sing our old songsYou never really know what you got 'till it's all goneCause all I just wanted was your loveI can hear your bodyI can taste your tearsI'm drowning in your oceanYou watch me disappearDon't tell me that it's overWere just getting olderRemember what we saidNo matter whats aheadWill only make us strongerCause all I just wanted was your loveThem birds in the sky sing our old songsYou never really know what you got 'till it's all goneCause all I just wanted was your love
