Here I go out to sea againThe sunshine fills my hairAnd dreams hang in the airGulls in the sky and in my blue eyesYou know it feels unfairThere's magic everywhereLook at me standingHere on my own againUp straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hideIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeNo need to laugh and cryIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeSun in your eyesThe heat is in your hairThey seem to hate youBecause you're thereAnd I need a friendOh, I need a friendTo make me happyNot stand here on my ownLook at me standingHere on my own againUp straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hideIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeNo need to laugh and cryIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeI need a friendOh, I need a friendTo make me happyNot so aloneLook at me hereHere on my own againUp straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hideIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeNo need to laugh and cryIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeNo need to run and hideIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeNo need to run and hideIt's a wonderful, wonderful lifeWonderful life, wonderful life
