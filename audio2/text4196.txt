Closed off from loveI didn't need the painOnce or twice was enoughAnd it was all in vainTime starts to passBefore you know it you're frozenBut something happenedFor the very first time with youMy heart melts into the groundFound something trueAnd everyone's looking roundThinking I'm going crazyBut I don't care what they sayI'm in love with youThey try to pull me awayBut they don't know the truthMy heart's crippled by the veinThat I keep on closingYou cut me open and IKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleedingI keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveTrying hard not to hearBut they talk so loudTheir piercing sounds fill my earsTry to fill me with doubtYet I know that the goalIs to keep me from fallingBut nothing's greaterThan the rush that comes with your embraceAnd in this world of lonelinessI see your faceYet everyone around meThinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybeBut I don't care what they sayI'm in love with youThey try to pull me awayBut they don't know the truthMy heart's crippled by the veinThat I keep on closingYou cut me open and IKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleedingI keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveYou cut me openAnd it's draining all of meOh they find it hard to believeI'll be wearing these scarsFor everyone to seeKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleedingI keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveYou cut me open and IKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleedingI keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleedingKeep, keep bleeding loveYou cut me open
