Look at meYou may think you see who I really amBut you’ll never know meEv’ry dayIt’s as if I play a partNow I seeIf I wear a maskI can fool the worldBut I cannot fool my heartWho is that girl I seeStaring straight back at me?When will my reflection showWho I am inside?I am nowIn a world where I have to hide my heartAnd what I believe inBut somehowI will show the worldWhat’s inside my heartAnd be loved for who I amWho is that girl I seeStaring straight back at me?Why is my reflection someone I don’t know?Must I pretend that I’mSomeone else for all time?When will my reflection showWho I am inside?There’s a heart that must be free to flyThat burns with a need to know the reason whyWhy must we all concealWhat we thinkHow we feelMust there be a secret meI’m forced to hide?I won’t pretend that I’mSomeone elseFor all timeWhen will my reflection showWho I am inside?Who I am inside?Who I am inside?When will my reflection showWho I amWho I am inside?Who I amWho I am
