Build a fire and gather 'round the treeFill a glass and maybe come and sing with meSo kiss me under the mistletoePour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snowI know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it goNext year, you never knowBut for now, Merry ChristmasWe'll dance in the kitchen while embers glowWe've both known love, but this love we got is the best of allI wish you could see it through my eyes then you would knowMy God! You look beautiful right nowMerry ChristmasThe fire is raging onAnd we'll all sing along to the songJust having so much funWhile we're here, can we all spare a thoughtFor the ones who have gone?Merry Christmas, everyone(Ah ah ah ahAh ah ah ah)So just keep kissing me under the mistletoePour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snowI know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it goNext year, you never knowBut for now, Merry ChristmasWe'll dance in the kitchen while embers glowWe've both known love, but this love we got is the best of allI wish you could see it through my eyes then you would knowMy God!
